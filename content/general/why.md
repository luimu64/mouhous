Some time ago I noticed that the only thing I do in certain friend group discord server is complain about different things. I have also been wanting to try out static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll for long time. Then recently I recommended hugo to one guy running wordpress website and realized that I can't really recommend something I know nothing about even if I know the tech itself is solid and tested to be great solution to the given problem.

These three things lead to the creation of this "blog" where I will complain about various things. I might post something useful too once in a while which is why there are the categories for general stuff and software. The main content will be for me to ramble about my insignificant problems for nobody to read tho. Even if literally nobody cares about this website I will still try to keep posting just to have something fun to look back to later in my life. At the end of the day this will probably be short term experiment which will get abandoned and forgotten but until then, enjoy the ride.

And just for the curious the the word "mouhous" is finnish slang for rambling about something non-important in angry fashion.
